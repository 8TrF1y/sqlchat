## What

SQL Chat is a chat-based SQL Client.

## Why

As we enter the [Developer Tools 2.0 era](https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/ai-powered-developer-tools/),
there is a massive opportunity to rebuild the existing tools using chat-based interface. SQL Client
is no exception. Instead of navigating across many UI controls, a chat-based interface is much
more intuitive. Of course, only if that works, and our goal is to deliver that experience.

## How

SQL Chat is built by Next.js, it supports following databases and will add more over the time:
* MySQL
* PostgreSQL

## Data Privacy

All database conenction configs are stored locally in your browser. You can also visit settings to
clear the data. 

## Local Development

```
